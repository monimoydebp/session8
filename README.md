Session8

## Description
This repository CIFAR10 dataset is trained with a 
ake this network:
* C1 C2 c3 P1 C3 C4 C5 c6 P2 C7 C8 C9 GAP C10,
*   Keep the parameter count less than 50000
* Try and add one layer to another
* Training is done with three different normalization i. Batch Normalization ii. Layer Normalization iii. Group Normalization

## Training Accuracy of Models

* Batch Normalization: 76.92
* Layer Normalization: 76.96
* Group Normalization: 76.08

## Test Accuracy of Models

* Batch Normalization: 78.59
* Layer Normalization: 79.12
* Group Normalization: 78.33

## 10 misclassified images with Batch Normalization
